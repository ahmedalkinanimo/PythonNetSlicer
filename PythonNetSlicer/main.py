The primary aim of this project is to develop an application that can subnet a 
given IPv4 address using three different subnetting methods. Additionally, the 
application validates the input IPv4 address and computes the corresponding network 
IPv4 address. For each network, the application determines the first, last, and 
broadcast IPv4 addresses and also computes the number of available usable IP 
addresses. The goal of this project is to accomplish these tasks without relying on 
any pre-existing network libraries.
Strategic Pattern Design will be utilized in this project.
